This repository provides a rudimentary implementation of predicting housing prices in Melbourne using logistics regression, with the dataset obtain from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market).

A slightly more comprehensive explanation of the notebook is published on my portfolio website. The prediction is split into 2 parts
1. [Basic Implementation of Log Regression](https://leonswl.github.io/lm-MelbourneHousing/)
2. [Experimenting with various Models](https://leonswl.github.io/lm-MelbourneHousing_2/)
